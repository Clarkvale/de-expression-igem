   summary:     
      Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in
 response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific 
physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravi
ty has not been extensively investigated. In this study, High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gr
avity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containin
g biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal grav
ity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥ 2-fo
ld and 94 genes down-regulated ≥ 2-fold during simulated microgravity HARV growth. These included a number of genes located on extrac
hromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these resul
ts suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may trans
late to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.
