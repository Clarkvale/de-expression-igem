      Four conditions are compared with three replicates each:  yeast grown in low-shear modeled microgravity (HARV bioreactor) for 5 and 25 g
enerations; yeast grown in a horizontal (non-LSMMG) HARV bioreactor for 5 and 25 generations.

   summary:     
      The goal of this study was to assess whether low shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG) effects yeast 
genomic expression patterns using the
 powerful tool of whole genome microarray hybridization. We determined 
changes in the yeast model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisisae, 
when grown in LSMMG using the rotating High 
Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV). A significant number of genes were up- or down-regulated by at 
least two fold in cells 
that were grown for 5 generations or 25 generations in HARVs. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signal
ing 
pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic 
cells to the externa
l stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment.  A comparison of the microgravity 
response to other environmental stress resp
onse (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond 
significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress respon
se, while 74% of the genes may 
represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity.  In addition, we found changes in genes inv
olved in 
budding, cell polarity establishment, and cell separation that confirm our hypothesis that exposure to LSMMG 
causes changes i
n gene transcription resulting in a phenotypic response. The results of the study provide interesting 
clues to potential mechanisms inv
olved in the response to, adaptation to, and survival of eukaryotic cells in a 
microgravity environment and our findings may have impor
tant health implications for human spaceflight.
