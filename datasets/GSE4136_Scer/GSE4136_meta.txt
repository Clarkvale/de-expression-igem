      Four conditions are compared with three replicates each:  yeast grown in low-shear modeled microgravity (HARV bioreactor) f
or 5 and 25 generations; yeast grown in a horizontal (non-LSMMG) HARV bioreactor for 5 and 25 generations.

   summary:     
      The goal of this study was to assess whether low shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG) effects yeast 
genomic expression patte
rns using the powerful tool of whole genome microarray hybridization. We determined 
changes in the yeast model organism, S
accharomyces cerevisisae, when grown in LSMMG using the rotating High 
Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV). A significant number of 
genes were up- or down-regulated by at least two fold in cells 
that were grown for 5 generations or 25 generations in HARV
s. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling 
pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to 
novel physiological responses of eukaryotic 
cells to the external stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment. 
 A comparison of the microgravity 
response to other environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes
 that respond 
significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress response, while 74% of the genes may 

represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity.  In addition, we found changes in genes involved in 
budding, 
cell polarity establishment, and cell separation that confirm our hypothesis that exposure to LSMMG 
causes changes in gene
 transcription resulting in a phenotypic response. The results of the study provide interesting 
clues to potential mechani
sms involved in the response to, adaptation to, and survival of eukaryotic cells in a 
microgravity environment and our fin
dings may have important health implications for human spaceflight.
