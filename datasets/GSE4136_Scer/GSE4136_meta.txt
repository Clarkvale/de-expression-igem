      Four conditions are compared with three replicates each:  yeast grown in low-shear modeled microgravity (HARV bio
reactor) for 5 and 25 generations; yeast grown in a horizontal (non-LSMMG) HARV bioreactor for 5 and 25 generatio
ns.

   summary:     
      The goal of this study was to assess whether low shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG) effects yeast 
genomic expres
sion patterns using the powerful tool of whole genome microarray hybridization. We determined 
changes in the yea
st model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisisae, when grown in LSMMG using the rotating High 
Aspect Ratio Vessel (H
ARV). A significant number of genes were up- or down-regulated by at least two fold in cells 
that were grown for
 5 generations or 25 generations in HARVs. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling 
pathways contain
ing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic 
cells to the exter
nal stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment.  A comparison of the microgravity 
response to other 
environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond 
significantly to LSMMG are i
nvolved in a general environmental stress response, while 74% of the genes may 
represent a unique transcriptiona
l response to microgravity.  In addition, we found changes in genes involved in 
budding, cell polarity establish
ment, and cell separation that confirm our hypothesis that exposure to LSMMG 
causes changes in gene transcriptio
n resulting in a phenotypic response. The results of the study provide interesting 
clues to potential mechanisms
 involved in the response to, adaptation to, and survival of eukaryotic cells in a 
microgravity environment and 
our findings may have important health implications for human spaceflight.
