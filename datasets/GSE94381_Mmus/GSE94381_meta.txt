   overall_design:     
      C57BL/N6 mice were randomly divided in 3 groups: Bion Flown (BF), mice flown aboard the Bion M1 biosatellite in microgravity environment for 30 d
ays; Bion Ground (BG), mice housed in the same habitat of flown animals but exposed to earth gravity; and Flight Control (FC), mice housed in a s
tandard animal facility.

   summary:     
      Microgravity as well as chronic muscle disuse are two causes of low back pain originated at least in part from paraspinal muscle deconditioning. 
At present no study investigated the complexity of the molecular changes in human or mouse paraspinal muscles exposed to microgravity. The aim of
 this study was to evaluate longissimus dorsi and tongue (as a new potential in-flight negative control) adaptation to microgravity at global gen
e expression level. C57BL/N6 male mice were flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days (BF) or housed in a replicate flight habitat on gro
und (BG). . Global gene expression analysis identified 89 transcripts differentially regulated in longissimus dorsi of BF vs. BG mice (False Disc
overy Rrate < 0,05 and fold change < -2 and > +2), while only a small number of genes were found differentially regulated in tongue muscle ( BF v
s. BG = 27 genes).
