   summary:     
      To reveal the potential mechanisms involved in the dysfunction of antiviral immune responses under simulated microgravity conditions, we investigated the transcrip
tional changes related to the status of innate immune responses by RNA-seq with poly I:C or mock PBS treatment under Normal gravity or simulated microgravity condi
tions. Our results indicate that the retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptor (RLR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal pathways, which are both involved
 in the type-I interferon induction, are significantly inhibited by simulated microgravity effects.
