   overall_design:     
      Rice calli were selected at different treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the diff-genes that caused by t
he microgravity.

   summary:     
      Four days old rice calli were selected to grow 324h under spaceflight controls, 1g-flight controls and 1g-ground controls.
We used microarrays to detail the global
 programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process.
