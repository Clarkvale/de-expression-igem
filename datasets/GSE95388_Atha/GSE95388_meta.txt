      The CEL (Cellular Expression Logic) experiment setup and organization was a modification of a previous Arabidopsis
 cell culture experiment in BRIC16 (Paul, Zupanska et al. 2012). The CEL BRIC17 experiment was launched on board t
he Dragon capsule of SpaceX-3 CRS mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on the 1st of March 2013.  The 
cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60mm Petri plates in P
etri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canister (BRIC) hardware. Two 
BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC17 payload. Each chamber housed 5 PDFUs, each PDFU h
olding one 60mm Petri plate. In each BRIC container there were 2 plates with wild type (WT) cells and 3 plates wit
h knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRICs on the ground in th
e ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as Ground Controls. The Ground Control
s were initiated with a 48 hrs delay so that the precise temperature environment of the ISS could be recreated for
 the ground controls in the ISSES chamber. Cells were fixed in-flight in RNAlater on the 10th day on orbit, and th
e ground controls were fixed 48 hours later. RNAlater fixation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool 
that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri Plate. Twenty four hours after fixation, t
he entire BRIC was moved to the MELFI (Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS) where it resided until cold
 stowage transport back to Earth within the Dragon capsule.  After returning to Earth the samples were reclaimed a
t KSC, and then transported to the University of Florida (UF) laboratories. The total RNA was extracted from space
flight samples and corresponding Ground Control samples and subjected to microarrays.

   summary:     
      The Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2), as a part of the HSF network, is essential to the plant’s response to almost a
ny environmental stress and to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms. Plant cell cultures disabled in HsfA2 
function were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in order to ascertain whether or not they use the
 same terrestrially effective systems to adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. Cultured lines of Arabidop
sis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 and from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding H
SFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of 
the BRIC17 spaceflight mission and were fixed in-flight after 10 days on orbit. Microarray gene expression data we
re analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between t
he environments (spaceflight to ground) within cells of the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptat
ion to the spaceflight environment. Second, gene expression profiles were identified between the genotypes (HSFA2 
KO to WT) within the same environment, defining genes uniquely required by the two genotypes in the ground and spa
ceflight adapted states.
The physiological state of the cells as a result of disabling a gene has tremendous contr
ol over the mechanisms induced to adapt to the environment of spaceflight.  The HsfA2 demonstrated a role in the p
hysiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment since the cells disabled in the HsfA2 gene used substantial
ly different genes to achieve the spaceflight adapted state than the WT cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stre
ss and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state regardless of the environm
ent and likely result from the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. HsfA2 seems to have
 a universal stress response role but also specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through c
ell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction and starch biosynthesis. Implementation of knock-out cells
 identified a set of genes with a required expression level in order for a cell to achieve a spaceflight-adapted s
tate. The HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the adaption of wild type cells to the env
ironment of spaceflight.
