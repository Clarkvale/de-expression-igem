   summary:     
      Purpose: Microgravity is one of crucial factors which affects astronauts’ health in space. The goals of this study are to compare SMG-pretreated macrophages infec
ted with EPEC by RNA-sequencing to investigate the immunity-related differential expression genes and signaling pathway and to make for prevention and therapy of in
fectious diseases in space.
Methods: 3-day SMG-pretreatment macrophages were infected with EPEC (a kind of enteropathogen) and macrophages infected with EPEC under 
normal gravity as control and then we used RNA sequencing on Illumina platform. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isofo
rm level by Volcano Plot, KEEG database and InnateDB database. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.
Results: After RNA sequencing, we got 127
2 differential expression genes (DEGs) of which 542 were up-regulated, 720 were down-regulated DEGs. KEGG pathway enrichment scatter plot showed that cytokine-cytok
ine receptor interaction and MAPK signaling pathway were optimal-related to infection immunity under simulated microgravity. Because of our study involved in infect
ion immunity, we chose a database on immunity called InnateDB to screen the DEGs related to immunity. We found 14 DEGs in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, of
 which 7 were up-regulated, and 7 were down-regulated and 36 DEGs in MAPK signaling pathway, of which 11 were up-regulated, and 25 were down-regulated. In cytokine-
cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway, except for Il 33 (P>0. 05), the results of mRNA expression of DEGs in macrophages infected with EPEC were consisten
t with the results of RNA sequencing. In MAPK signaling pathway, the mRNA expression of Il 1b, Cd14, Hspa1a, Pdgfrb, Il 1a, Fgf7, Igf1r and Pak1 was not consistent 
with the RNA sequencing. Compared with normal gravity, simulated microgravity didn’t affect the mRNA expression of Il 1b, Cd14, Hspa1a and Pdgfrb (P>0. 05). The I
l 1a and Fgf7 down regulated and Igf1r and Pak1 up regulated under simulated microgravity at the level of mRNA with a comparison to normal gravity, and the results 
of the rest of DEGs were consistent with the results of RNA sequencing.
Conclusions: This study is the first high-throughput analysis on simulated microgravity of i
nfection immunity. The comparative analysis demonstrates that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and MAPK signaling pathway participants in the innate immune re
sponse.
