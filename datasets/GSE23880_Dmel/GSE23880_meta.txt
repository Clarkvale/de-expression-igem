   overall_design:     
      Larval microarrays (FL 6 samples) are based on RNA extracted from 6 indepen
dent sets of 50 mid 3rd instar larvae reared in microgravity and collected 
on the day of landing after 12 days and 18.5 hours on the space shuttle and
 the same number of control larvae raised on ground (GL 6 samples). Adults 
microarrays (F1 3 samples) are based on RNA from 3 sets of 20 adult females
 each, that emerged during spaceflight and within 4 hours of landing and th
e same number of adult females from the corresponding ground control contai
ners (G1 3 samples).

   summary:     
      Gene expression levels were determined in 3rd instar and adult Drosophila m
elanogaster reared during spaceflight, to elucidate the genetic and molecul
ar mechanisms underpinning the effects of microgravity on the immune system
.  The goal was to validate the Drosophila model for understanding alterati
ons of innate immune responses in humans due to spaceflight. Five container
s of flies, with ten female and five male fruit flies in each container, we
re housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 k
m) for 12 days and 18.5 hours, with a new generation reared in microgravity
.  RNA was extracted on the day of shuttle landing from whole body animals 
(3rd instar larvae and adults), hybridized to Drosophila 2.0 Affymetrix gen
ome arrays, and the expression level of all genes was normalized against th
e gene expression level from the corresponding developmental stage animals 
raised on ground.  Spaceflight altered the expression of larval genes invol
ved in the maturation of plasmatocytes (macrophages) and their phagocytic r
esponse, as well as the level of constitutive expression of pattern recogni
tion receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of ly
sozymes, antimicrobial peptide pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks o
f humoral immunity.
